# Zavala FPGA Miner

Zavala is essentially an FPGA-based cryptocurrency miner. Miners play an important part in cryptocurrency mining to validate and update the blockchain ledger after every transaction taking place in that particular blockchain. Mining is mainly categorized into two modes i) GPU mining and ii) ASIC mining. A Field Programmable Gate Array is a device commonly used to simulate digital circuitry and logic. An FPGA miner basically bridges these two modes of mining, from general-purpose to application-specific since it is reprogrammable and also provides us with the ability to improve upon the hardware.
